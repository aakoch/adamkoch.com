| I really just wanted a password manager that would sync to my different computers. I didn't need the autologin, but tried it. It rarely worked the way I expected. I didn't like that logins for different subdomains brought up the passwords for all of the subdomains on my domain. I tried to change my Google password to a more secure one and almost locked myself out of the account because LastPass didn't do something (I believe it should have prompted me at some point). The sites I tested, LastPass didn't prompt me to autocomplete nor to save a changed password. I tried to import my logins from Password Safe and somehow there were many duplicate entries. LastPass doesn't allow a way to merge the duplicates.
