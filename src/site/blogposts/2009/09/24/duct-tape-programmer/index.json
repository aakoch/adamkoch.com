But if you are to build an app that can easily have features added, then this is <strong>not</strong> the way to go.\r\n\r\nThe Duct Tape Programmer mentioned in the article is Jamie Zawinski. He used (?) to work for Netscape. And says \"It was decisions like not using C++ and not using threads that made us ship the product on time.\" Yea, but what eventually happened to Netscape? Sure, Netscape got it's browser out the door, but now where are they?\r\n\r\nEven the example given about a go-cart seems to strengthen my point: sure, the duct taped go-cart will be shipped faster, but how many times can it race?\r\n\r\nIt just seems to emphasize my point that duct tape programming is fine for small apps with no future.","excerpt:encoded":"Joel Spolsky's latest blog post is entitled \"The Duct Tape Programmer\" and is getting a lot of attention out there.
