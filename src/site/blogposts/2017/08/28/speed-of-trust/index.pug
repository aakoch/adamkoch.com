| I am getting more convinced that the Stephen Covey idea of the “Speed of Trust” is important. Just today I wasted a bunch of time searching for a wiki page in the corporate network only to come to the conclusion I can’t find it because it is hidden from me. Why was I looking for it? To fix a misspelling. Something that would have taken 20 seconds ended up taking much longer. Because after I couldn’t find the page I had to screenshot the typo and send it to the owner (or someone with edit access to change it). How much would it have taken to trust me and add me to the list of people that can view that page? Another example was during our deployment: if we trusted a step was done by another team we wouldn’t have wasted our time validating something they probably already validated.
