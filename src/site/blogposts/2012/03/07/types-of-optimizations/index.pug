| This post was created a long time ago. I'm just publishing it now. I was thinking of my optimization categories and thought I needed to rethink my categories. First we have the "value" optimizations: colors, quotes around urls, combining values. These are all "safe". Also "safe" was the removal of characters that don't even get parsed: whitespace and comments. The next level of optimizations I think of as "declaration" optimizations: optimizations that are dependent of the declaration and optimizations that are just declaration optimizations. I can't compress the font-weight values unless it is for the font-weight declaration. "(declaration) block" optimizations: whitespace? comments? "rule" optimizations: combining rules, removing empty rules "rule-set" optimizations: combining rules "style sheet" optimizations "gzip" optimizations: making anything lowercase
