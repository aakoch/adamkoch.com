    .content
      p I got a message from a recruiter today on LinkedIn and I wanted to give him some pointers. As someone on the receiving end of 
        strike  a lot of  
        |  some messages from recruiters, I can tell you want makes me want to hear more. So here are my 
      h2 Top 3 Tips for Recruiters...

      h3 Location, Location, Location
      p I can think of 2 types of messages could get away with doing this: the short ones or 100% remote ones.  Some recruiters send messages with very little details. They either are respecting your time or they don't have a lot of time. It's fine either way. I also like to think there are other recruiters that don't send a lot of information are trying to allure me by being mysterious. The other messages that can get a way with no location are those for a 100% remote position. 
      p If you're not one of those 2, then tell me the location! You've gotta know that is very important. If I'm in a position where I don't want to move, they I can tell you right off the bat that I'm not interested in the job. If you don't provide a location and you're the one reaching out to me then I will most likely ignore your message. 
      p But the worst is when they tease you!
      img(ngSrc='/assets/recruiter_ohio.png')
      p As I'm reading this, I'm thinking, "... oh, Des Moines, that's not far ... oh now just somewhere in the Midwest ... Ohio! At least we have in narrowed to a state... and now we don.t."

      h3 The Tech
      p When new technology is even mentioned in a message I've received, my ears perk up a bit. New tech really interests us! If you can at least pretend you're doing cool things I'll be interested. I don't know if all developers are this way.  And when you mention technologies, can you sound like you know what you're talking about? 
      blockquote 
        .quote Right now they are wanting individuals with a great background in Java, Spring, and Boot (to name a few), but in the future, would definitely be working on other projects with different technologies.
        .tagline Not terrible, but it's not just "Boot"
      

      h3 Grammar
      p I have a thing about grammar and I scrutinize recruiters' messages. Bad grammar comes off as either unprofessional, lazy or dumb. And those are turn offs for me. 

      h3 Bonus!
      p If I don't know you I am not going to give you the names of my friends so you can bother them too. I know it's rough finding people right now, but it comes off ... wrong.

      h3 Bonus bonus!
      p Your company doesn't come off any better if you say there's a strong work/life balance. Everyone is saying that these days.

      h3 Addendum (added 2022-01-04)
      p I just got done reading the article 
        a(href="https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/six-ways-to-make-a-recruiter-hate-you") The quickest ways to make a recruiter hate you
        | . (It used to be called "Six ways to make a recruiter hate you" as evident by the URL.) 
        | I thought I would add something here. 
      p I usually skip over recruiters who don't take the time to read my resume/LinkedIn profile. I hate getting questions that could've been gleamed from just skimming either of them. I want to point out that this doesn't make me hate someone. Hate is a strong word.
      p Another example: I was presented with a job description that sounded exactly like what I quit 9 months ago. 
      p If I don't feel like you spent time reading my resume or LinkedIn profile I don't think you'll have my best interests in mind when trying to fill positions.
