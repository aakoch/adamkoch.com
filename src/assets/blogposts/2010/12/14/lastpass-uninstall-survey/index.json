I didn't need the autologin, but tried it. It rarely worked the way I expected. I didn't like that logins for different subdomains brought up the passwords for all of the subdomains on my domain. I tried to change my Google password to a more secure one and almost locked myself out of the account because LastPass didn't do something (I believe it should have prompted me at some point). The sites I tested, LastPass didn't prompt me to autocomplete nor to save a changed password. I tried to import my logins from Password Safe and somehow there were many duplicate entries. LastPass doesn't allow a way to merge the duplicates.","excerpt:encoded":"","wp:post_id":"1886","wp:post_date":"2010-12-14 07:50:01","wp:post_date_gmt":"2010-12-14 13:50:01","wp:post_modified":["2010-12-14 07:50:17"],"wp:post_modified_gmt":["2010-12-14 13:50:17"],"wp:comment_status":["open"],"wp:ping_status":["open"],"wp:post_name":"lastpass-uninstall-survey","wp:status":"publish","wp:post_parent":["0"],"wp:menu_order":["0"],"wp:post_type":"post","wp:post_password":[""],"wp:is_sticky":["0"],"category":[{"_":"Professional","$":{"domain":"category","nicename":"professional"}}],"wp:postmeta":[{"wp:meta_key":["aktt_notify_twitter"],"wp:meta_value":["no"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_edit_last"],"wp:meta_value":["1"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_wp_old_slug"],"wp:meta_value":["lastpass-unistall-survey"]},{"wp:meta_key":["_jetpack_related_posts_cache"],"wp:meta_value":["a:1:{s:32:\"8f6677c9d6b0f903e98ad32ec61f8deb\";a:2:{s:7:\"expires\";i:1628203689;s:7:\"payload\";a:3:{i:0;a:1:{s:2:\"id\";i:2785;}i:1;a:1:{s:2:\"id\";i:2904;}i:2;a:1:{s:2:\"id\";i:1730;}}}}"]}],"tidyCategory":"Professional","tidyTags":[]}
