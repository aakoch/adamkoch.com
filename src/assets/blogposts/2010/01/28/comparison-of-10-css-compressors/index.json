I really didn't expect it to take a week to put this together. Along the way I discovered more ways of compression: some from the tools I evaluated and some I thought of along the way.</p>\r\n<p>I began my research by taking the list of 10 compressors from <a href=\"http://designshack.co.uk/\">Design Shack's</a> <a href=\"http://designshack.co.uk/articles/css/18-css-compression-tools-and-techniques\">18 CSS Compression Tools and Techniques article</a> by <a title=\"Posts by Joshua Johnson\" href=\"http://designshack.co.uk/author/joshuajohnson/\">Joshua Johnson</a>. I replaced one with the tool I currently use, <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/\">YUI compressor</a>. <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/\">YUI compressor</a> is the only tool that can be downloaded and added to the build process. I also consulted the wonderful resource found at <a href=\"http://www.lotterypost.com/css-compress.aspx\">Lottery Post</a>. The next step was to create a <a href=\"/10csscompressors/simple.css\">CSS file</a>, feed it to each of the compressors and compared them. I was going to use the color name \"ForestGreen\" but because it wouldn't pass <a href=\"http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/\">CSS validation</a> I used the CSS-compliant color name \"fuchsia\". The original file has a size of 4.01KB. Keeping the CSS file simple was difficult. Compressors were thrown off I placed comments in strange places, but in the end I left those fringe cases out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Compressors</h2>\r\n<p>Here are the compressors, listed alphabetically.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"#arantius\">Arantius CSS Compressor</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"#cleancss\">CleanCSS</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"#csscompressor\">CSS Compressor</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"#cssdrive\">CSS Drive</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"#cssoptimiser\">CSS Optimiser</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"#lotterypost\">Lottery Post</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"#phpinsider\">PHP Insider</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"#pingates\">Pingates</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"#sevenforty\">Seven-forty</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"#yui\">YUI compressor</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Compression Techniques</h2>\r\n<p>The compression techniques that I was looking for spanned from &quot;simple and expected&quot; to &quot;difficult and potentially behavior-changing&quot;. <a href=\"http://www.lotterypost.com/css-compress.aspx\">Lottery Post</a> does a good job explaining some advanced compression techniques and why they are dangerous. I decided to break up the compression techniques into categories.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Safe</li>\r\n\t<li>Unconventional</li>\r\n\t<li>Dangerous</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Safe</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Removes comments</li>\r\n\t<li>Removes whitespace</li>\r\n\t<li>Removes empty blocks</li>\r\n\t<li>Removes decimals</li>\r\n\t<li>Removes units from zero values&sup1</li>\r\n\t<li>Removes quotes from URIs</li>\r\n\t<li>Reduces margin, padding, border-width</li>\r\n    <li>Compresses hex colors</li>\r\n    <li>Compresses colors by hex or name, whichever is shorter</li>\r\n    <li>Converts RGB to hex</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The &quot;safe&quot; techniques I expected to see from most compressors, although some did surprise me. These should have no ill effects, such as removing quotes around URIs&sup2;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Unconventional</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Removes duplicate rules</li>\r\n\t<li>Removes overwritten rules</li>\r\n\t<li>Compresses font weight</li>\r\n\t<li>Changes color names to lowercase</li>\r\n\t<li>Changes color hex values to lowercase</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>These techniques shouldn't affect the behavior of the page and were either not very common or I hadn't seen them before -- especially compressing the font weight. Only two compressors did this -- <a href=\"http://www.csscompressor.com/\">CSS Compressor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cleancss.com/\">CleanCSS</a>. You might wonder why changing the colors to lowercase would help. Well, using lowercase letters helps when you GZIP your files&sup3;. In a simple test, using lowercase RBG hex values saved me two bytes after GZIP compression.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Dangerous</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Converts tag names to lowercase</li>\r\n\t<li>Combines styles for the same element</li>\r\n\t<li>Combines font styles</li>\r\n\t<li>Combines margins, paddings, borders</li>\r\n\t<li>Combines same styles from different elements</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Techniques 2-5 match up to the ones <a href=\"http://www.lotterypost.com/css-compress.aspx\">Lottery Post</a> won't perform because of the possibility of changing the behavior. I often don't use the &quot;Cascading&quot; part of &quot;Cascading Style Sheets&quot; so I don't think it would affect any of my CSS. Again, changing the case where you can will help GZIP compression. Beware, though. This is safe for HTML, but not safe for XML<sup>4</sup>. In a simple test, changing &quot;DIV&quot; to &quot;div&quot; did save one byte after GZIP compression. (I know, &quot;1 byte&quot;. But we're talking about <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zachleat/status/6902476988\">micro-optimizations</a>.) Since none of the compressors changed the tags' case, I didn't include it in the summary table.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Commonalities</h2>\r\n<p>All compressors removed some comments and most whitespace. Most compressors tried to compress hex color values. But besides this, there were very little that all compressors shared.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Compressor Results</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"arantius\" id=\"arantius\" href=\"http://tools.arantius.com/css-compressor\">Arantius CSS Compressor</a></h3>\r\n<p>I wasn't too impressed with the Arantius compressor. It removed spaces and single line comments, but not multi-line ones. The compressor removed all possible semicolons, minus the extra one in the \"removesExtraSemicolons\" class.  Everything else was unchanged. \r\n<a href=\"/10csscompressors/arantius.css\">Output CSS</a> - 1.95KB</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"cleancss\" id=\"cleancss\" href=\"http://www.cleancss.com/\">CleanCSS</a></h3>\r\n<p>CleanCSS applied most techniques, but did miss 2 &quot;safe&quot; ones (removing the decimals and removing quotes around URLs) and one &quot;dangerous&quot; technique of combining font styles. Otherwise, it was one of the better compressors. It was one of only two that compressed the font-weight and was smart enough to remove overwritten and duplicate rules. It combined individual margins and paddings when all four sides were present and grouped classes with the same style. It tied for second place in smallest file size.<br/>\r\n<a href=\"/10csscompressors/cleancss.css\">Output CSS</a> - 1.51KB</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"csscompressor\" id=\"csscompressor\" href=\"http://www.csscompressor.com/\">CSS Compressor</a></h3>\r\n<p>CSS Compressor had some options and I tried to use the most aggresive ones. Here is the setup I used: &quot;Highest&quot; compression mode, checked &quot;Remove last ;&quot; and unchecked &quot;Only safe optimisations&quot;<br />\r\nThis compressor was the best. It removed all possible spaces and semicolons. CSS compressor also compressed the font-weight and did a remarkable job of combining rules, even combining the \"removesURLSingleQuotes\" and \"removesURLDoubleQuotes\" which some other compressors missed. CSS Compressor had the smallest compressed file size.\r\n<br/><a href=\"/10csscompressors/csscompressor.css\">Output CSS</a> - 1.50KB</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"cssdrive\" id=\"cssdrive\" href=\"http://www.cssdrive.com/index.php/main/csscompressor/\">CSS Drive</a></h3>\r\n<p>CSS drive didn't do a very good job. It did a mediocre job removing spaces. It didn't remove any empty blocks or change RGB colors. It had the second to largest file size.<br/>\r\n<a href=\"/10csscompressors/cssdrive.css\">Output CSS</a> - 1.94KB</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"cssoptimiser\" id=\"cssoptimiser\" href=\"http://www.cssoptimiser.com/index.php\">CSS Optimiser</a></h3>\r\n<p>This compressor did an adequate job compressing styles. Some quirks though: it took my one class of &quot;removesDuplicateRules&quot; and declared it twice. <br/>\r\n<code style=\"display:inline\">.removesDuplicateRules,.removesDuplicateRules{width:4%}</code>\r\n<br/>\r\nIt removed zero value pixel units, but not percentages or <code style=\"display:inline\">em</code>s. It did simple hex color compression, but didn't touch the RGB colors. It was one of two that compressed my font styles into one font declaration. It tried to reduce the size of the margin classes, but because of the length of the class name, actually increased the size of the file. (\".combineIndividualMargins3\" is larger than \"margin-left:2px\".)\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"/10csscompressors/cssoptimiser.css\">Output CSS</a> - 1.57KB</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"lotterypost\" id=\"lotterypost\" href=\"http://www.lotterypost.com/css-compress.aspx\">Lottery Post</a></h3>\r\n<p>Lottery Post is a very good CSS compressor for what it says it will do. <del datetime=\"2010-01-29T19:01:00-06:00\">Except for removing decimals</del> it used all the <del datetime=\"2010-01-29T19:01:00-06:00\">other</del> &quot;easy&quot; techniques. It doesn't try the &quot;unconventional&quot; or &quot;dangerous&quot; techniques and gives good reason not to. Lottery Post also boasts that it is the only compressor to fix a CSS bug in IE6 pertaining to &quot;:first-line&quot; and &quot;:first-letter&quot;.\r\nI was disappointed to see my decimal RGB colors incorrectly converted. &quot;rgb(250, 150, 50)&quot; should have changed to &quot;#fa9632&quot; but instead was &quot;#FAFAFA&quot;. And both RGB percentages were converted to &quot;#FFF&quot; If those two issues were fixed I would confidentally call this one a very good &quot;safe&quot; compressor.<br/>\r\n<a href=\"/10csscompressors/lotterypost.css\">Output CSS</a> - 1.75KB</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"phpinsider\" id=\"phpinsider\" href=\"http://www.phpinsider.com/compress_css.php\">PHP Insider</a></h3>\r\n<p>This compressor removed new lines, tabs and comments. And that's it. It had the largest compressed file size.<br/>\r\n<a href=\"/10csscompressors/phpinsider.css\">Output CSS</a> - 2.00KB</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"pingates\" id=\"pingates\" href=\"http://tools.pingates.com/\">Pingates</a></h3>\r\n<p>The good: Pingates did a good job of removing spaces and combining styles. It removed duplicate and overwritten rules. It was one of only two to compress the font styles and the only one to change color values to lowercase.<br/>\r\nThe bad: RGB colors were incorrectly changed. URL quotes values were escaped instead of removed.<br/>\r\nThe ugly: It replaced my class name &quot;removesAllWhiteSpace&quot; to &quot;removesAll#ffffffSpace&quot;.<br/>\r\n<a href=\"/10csscompressors/pingates.css\">Output CSS</a> - 1.51KB</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"sevenforty\" id=\"sevenforty\" href=\"http://www.sevenforty.com/tools/csscompressor\">Seven-forty</a></h3>\r\n<p>A light compressor, it only tried the &quot;easy&quot; compression techniques and then, not real well. Whitespace was removed, but it didn't remove trailing semicolons, something I've come to expect. It incorrectly changed my &quot;background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0)&quot; to &quot;#ff00&quot;.<br/>\r\n<a href=\"/10csscompressors/sevenforty.css\">Output CSS</a> - 1.86KB</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"yui\" id=\"yui\" href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/\">YUI compressor</a></h3>\r\n<p>&quot;Ah. Saving the best for last,&quot; I thought. I thought wrong. I was surprised when the YUI compressor didn't even remove trailing semicolons! Yikes! Because it is open-source, you can download it and change what you want to. And because it is packaged as a jar file, it can be easily integrated into an Ant build process. But as far as removing bits, it lacked, settling only on trying the &quot;safe&quot; techniques.<br/>\r\n<a href=\"/10csscompressors/yui.css\">Output CSS</a> - 1.84KB</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>The conclusion I came to is no compressor does it all. And as for my development, I should probably look for something other than YUI compressor. I might have to develop my own compressor that I can plug into my build process.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" id=\"a\" style=\"border-spacing:

I am also humbled by the nice comments about the Lottery Post CSS Compressor.\r\n\r\nI was mortified to read that there is a bug in the RGB translation, so I took a look at the code, and it's a really dopey error on my part.  It's fixed in dev, and I'm going to push out an update hopefully by tomorrow (Jan. 29).\r\n\r\nI really appreciate that you pointed out the problem.\r\n\r\nI'm also going to try and add the lower-case color conversion - every byte counts!  I had not heard about that one.  Since I gzip everything myself, I'll be enjoying the micro-savings.\r\n\r\nOne big reason to include micro-savings: over time, high volume sites like Lottery Post chew up a lot of bandwidth, and all those bytes really do add up, in both performance and real dollars.\r\n\r\nA few other comments:\r\n\r\n- The LP CSS Compressor does in fact remove decimals, and it is in the documentation on the site.  For example, 10.0px becomes 10px.\r\n\r\n- Something else it does - which I failed to document (I will rememdy) is that it removes a leading zero before a decimal point.  For example, 0.9em becomes .9em.  (A safe conversion.)\r\n\r\n- Another small, safe savings achieved by Lottery Post (but not yet documented) is removing the space(s) before \"!important\".  I'm not sure if this is worthy of mention, but I didn't see it in the descriptions.\r\n\r\nAgain, excellent article, and fantastic job on the comparison table!\r\n\r\n-Todd"],"wp:comment_approved":["1"],"wp:comment_type":["comment"],"wp:comment_parent":["0"],"wp:comment_user_id":["0"]},{"wp:comment_id":["660"],"wp:comment_author":["Charles"],"wp:comment_author_email":["info@psdxhtmlycss.com"],"wp:comment_author_url":["http://psdxhtmlycss.com"],"wp:comment_author_IP":["83.32.47.68"],"wp:comment_date":["2010-02-14 13:57:36"],"wp:comment_date_gmt":["2010-02-14 19:57:36"],"wp:comment_content":["Great article and thanks for the list.
