      +project('Lightbulbs', "In Progress")
        p What do you do with hundreds of burnt-out incandescent light bulbs? Save 'em for years until you can think of what to do with 'em. I'm right on schedule. 
        p Currently I'm creating my own slip ring. 

      +project('Timesheet', 'Slowing')
