  //- configuration in .cssnanorc.  I have to turn off minifyGradients because of a bug in cssnano

        | leave notifications on at all times 

      .rule: p.
        Mom or Dad can DENY having people over at ANY time. Do not expect friends to come over on school nights but allowances can be made in certain situations.

      .rule: p.
        Bedtime means in your room trying to sleep. Some leeway is given for devices (TV, Echo Dot) that help you sleep. No watching/listening adrenaline inducing TV shows, movies, metal music (unless that's soothing to you according to your mother), etc.

      .rule: p.
        We don’t have huge or unreasonable expectations for you, please respect us and the expectations we lay out.  If you show us respect, we will respect you, and with earned respect comes privileges. 

      .rule: p.
        Any commitments are just that. They are not to be broken.  We expect any commitment made to be a priority and to be completed to the best of your ability. 
      
      .rule.unratified: p.
        We expect texts to be answered within 30 minutes unless safety would be compromised.

      .rule.unratified: p.
        Phone calls should be answered always.
