  section A note on categories
    p I've tried to categorize my projects as either "Physical" or "Digital". There is usually some overlap, so think 
      | of it as a Venn diagram where some projects will most likely be both.

    +project('Color Changing Outdoor Light', 'In Progress', 'Physical')
      p My wife has this globe garden decoration that hasn't worked for years and I've started fiddling around with it. 
        s I'm currently waiting for parts now.
        |  Parts are in, but I've hit a snag.

    +project('ESP32', 'In Progress', 'Digital')
      p When I started working on the Lucid Gloves, I didn't expect to be sucked into playing with microcontrollers. 
        | I've been having fun playing with the ESP32 microtroller and some cheap sensors. I even created 
        a(href="https://github.com/aakoch/ESP32_projects") a Github repo
        |  .

    +project('Lucid Gloves', '"Best by" Date Approaching', 'Physical')
      p Only 
        a(routerLink="../posts/posts/2022/04/30") a blog post about supplies 
        |  so far.

    +project('Attention Grabber', "In Production", 'Physical')
      p As a parent of a video game-playing teenage boy, it is sometime hard to get his attention. This is an ESP32 running a web server with a light attached. 

    +project('Light bulbs', "In Progress", 'Physical')
      p What do you do with hundreds of burnt-out incandescent light bulbs? Save 'em for years until you can think of what to do with 'em. I'm right on schedule. 
      p Currently I'm creating my own slip ring.

    +project('Ring Swing Game', 'In Progress', 'Physical')
      p A game that I saw at a graduation party that I wanted to enhance. It's pretty low priority.

    +project('Foo-Dog', 'In Progress', 'Digital') 
      p A Pug replacement with similar constructs. Not yet visible to the public.

    +project('Timesheet', 'Slowing', 'Digital')
      p A project to help be track my time at work. I've published a early version (0.1.2) on NPM.

    +project('Rain Train Fix', 'In Progress', 'Physical') 
      p I have a rain train that has stopped working. Water pours out of the bottom. I bought a replacement o-ring but it's too big and doesn't allow the "arms" to spin. I have to go back and try again.

    +project('Animations', 'Stale', 'Digital')
      p Just some fun I've been having with CSS animations. If something doesn't work for you,

    +project('Swamp Fan', 'On Hold', 'Physical')

      h3 1.0.0 Released
      .releaseDate.mb-3 2021-08-31
      p I felt obligated to release 1.0.0 of the site when I read on 
        a(href='https://semver.org/spec/v1.0.0.html' title='Semantic Versioning') semver.org 
        |  that if you are in production, you should be at least 1.0. So, I pushed 1.0.0 today. And of course, writing this probably makes me have to bump this up a version. I won't if it's just a new post, but I really don't have posts up yet. So here's to 1.0.1! üçæ
